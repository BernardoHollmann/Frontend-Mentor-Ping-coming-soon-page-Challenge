# Frontend Mentor - Ping coming soon page

This is a solution to the Ping coming soon page challenge(https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ping-single-column-coming-soon-page-5cadd051fec04111f7b848da). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

  - Frontend Mentor | Ping coming soon page
  - The challenge consisted in replicating a page for a desktop and mobile view perspective. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page. Receive an error message when the input field is empty or if the email address is not formatted correctly.
  - Here it is two screenshots taken from desktop and mobile perspective;

- My process
  - Built with: HTML + CSS + Javascript
  - I have to say that, after finishing the previous challenge (signup form), this was easy to do. However, I had to say that I am not 100% satisfied with the responsiveness of the layout. I tried to make to dashboard image shrink better along with the page itself, but I couldn't do it. Its shrinking too much. The other problem I had was with the icons. I tried using the fontawesome ones, but I couldn't figure out how to make a circle outside of each one. The other problem with the layout was the error message for the mobile view. To be honest, I felt like it would take me a lot of time to adjust it according to the given layout and I left as is. Itâ€™s not wrong, but it is not like the given design. Whatever... As for the Javascript part, it was the same as the previous one. I just had to a few adjustments to make it work in this project.
